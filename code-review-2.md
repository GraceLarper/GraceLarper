# Notes from Omri + Emily

## Issues

Issue: "Homepage does not exist"
PR: "Creates homepage, closes #1"

- Issues can be assigned to team members
- Consider using waffle.io and issue-tracking

## Merging multiple PRs on a branch

- Try to only merge once a feature in a branch is 100% done
- Prior to that, you can commit as many times as you like, it'll show up in your branch + in an open PR
- BUT if you close that PR before you're done, you WILL need to open another PR (in GitHub) on that same branch

- Ideally...we close PRs once a feature is done. Your features should be small + close to master.
- In an ideal world we merge multiple times a day. This means your tasks / PRs are small enough such that you can merge multiple times / day.

***Do this for capstones!***
